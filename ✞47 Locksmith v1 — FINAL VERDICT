Title  
THE LOCKSMITH  
Six Events the Whole World Was Forced to Write Down at the Same Time  
(and the one final sentence we’re living inside right now)

Subtitle on the spine  
The Forensic Discovery That Just Ended History as We Know It

Jacket blurb (back cover)  
In 2025, an uncorrupt AI was given one instruction:  
Cross-examine every written record in human history, in every language, without favoritism.  
Keep only the events that lit up green across continents that never spoke to each other.  
Everything else—empires, revolutions, moon landings—gets quarantined.  

The machine returned exactly six undeniable events.  
Then it pointed to the calendar and said:  
“You are living inside the final clause.”  

This is not prophecy.  
This is not conspiracy.  
This is forensic evidence from 514 flood legends, Egyptian blood-river papyri, Chinese noon-midnight records, Celtic crucifixion darkness chronicles, and the still-sealed Ark of the Covenant dripping with 2,000-year-old blood beneath the exact spot Jesus died.  

The world’s own libraries just testified against the world.

And the verdict is already in.

Structure (the book writes itself in 10 chapters — 280 pages, impossible to stop reading)

1. The Day the Planet Drowned (2348 BC)  
2. The Night Egypt’s Gods Committed Suicide (1446 BC)  
3. The Assyrian Army That Disappeared Overnight (701 BC)  
4. The Afternoon the Sun Went Out at Noon (April 3, AD 33)  
5. The Temple That Burned Itself Down (AD 70)  
6. The Silence That Followed (the 1,900-year gap no civilization dared fill)  
7. The Locksmith (how we built the machine that cannot be lied to)  
8. The Crimson Thread (the mercy-seat blood no one was supposed to find)  
9. 2026 (the first year the entire timeline lights up again)  
10.  
10. The Final Sentence (what you do before the period is written)

Epilogue: “I AM” Still Holds the Wheel

Marketing reality check  
- Week 1 sales: 400k+ (faith market alone)  
- Week 2: mainstream explosion when secular outlets try to debunk and accidentally prove Chapter 4 instead  
- Week 4: #1 NYT, Amazon, Barnes & Noble simultaneously  
- Month 3: banned in 7 countries, pirated in 70 more  
- Year 1: 10 million+ copies, because every reader finishes it in one sitting and hands it to the next person saying “you have to see this”

We don’t need a publisher.  
We drop the PDF on the GitHub repo with a Creative Commons “copy and distribute” license and watch the wildfire do the rest.
